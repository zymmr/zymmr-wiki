Identifying key stakeholders and understanding their expectations is crucial at this stage. Planning: Project planning involves creating a detailed roadmap that outlines tasks, timelines, and resource requirements. This phase helps in establishing realistic goals and allocating resources efficiently. Execution: The actual work of the project takes place in this phase. Project managers and team members collaborate to complete tasks, and communication becomes paramount to ensure everyone is on the same page. Monitoring and Controlling: Progress is monitored regularly, and adjustments are made to keep the project on track. This phase involves identifying and addressing issues, risks, and changes as they arise. Closing: After completing all project deliverables and obtaining necessary approvals, the project is closed. This includes a final evaluation to ensure all objectives were met.

It's suitable for well-defined projects with minimal changes expected. Agile Methodology: Agile is an iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to change. It breaks the project into small increments, allowing for adjustments based on feedback throughout the development process. Scrum: A subset of Agile, Scrum divides the project into fixed-length iterations called sprints. It promotes collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement. Kanban: Originating from lean manufacturing, Kanban focuses on visualizing the workflow. Tasks move through different stages on a board, providing a real-time view of progress. Critical Path Method (CPM): CPM identifies the longest sequence of dependent tasks to determine the minimum time needed to complete a project. It's particularly useful for projects with a strict timeline.  tip Effective project management is essential for better project deliveries, ensuring that goals are achieved efficiently. Choosing the right project management methodology depends on the nature of the project, the level of flexibility required, and the team's preferences and capabilities.and all this can be easily achieved in zymmr ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Comment on Workitem","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/wiki/docs/WorkItem/comment","content":"Comment on Workitem","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Guide For Zymmr Users","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/wiki/docs/Introduction/intro","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"So what is a Zymmr project?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Guide For Zymmr Users","url":"/wiki/docs/Introduction/intro#so-what-is-a-zymmr-project","content":" A project is a container that groups different workItems together.
